Generate subtitles, chapters, and summaries of videos in seconds with the help of OpenAI.

ðŸš§ This is very much a work-in-progress, please [create issues](https://github.com/aschmelyun/subvert/issues/new) for bugs if they appear ðŸš§

## Getting started

You'll need:

- [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your local machine
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

Subvert is self-contained in a single Docker image and can be started with a one-line command:

```
docker run -it -p 80:80 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-123abc aschmelyun/subvert
```

This will boot up a server running the application and make it available to your machine at http://localhost.

## How it works

After selecting a video file to process, you have the option of choosing whether you also want to generate chapters and a summary.

Your video is sent to an API where the audio is extracted from it using FFMpeg, and then sent to **OpenAI's Whisper model** for transcription into the common vtt format.

If you chose to select chapters or a summary, that transcript is then sent to a **ChatGPT model** for processing into concise chapters of the length you wanted, and a brief summary that would fit in something like a YouTube description.

## Configuration

You can adjust a few parameters in the container by passing in [environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#env) with your command using additional `-e` flags. Here are the current ones you can add:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` **(required)** - Sets the key responsible for communication with OpenAI's APIs. No default.
- `UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE` - Changes PHP's UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE setting. Default: `256M`
- `MEMORY_LIMIT` - Changes PHP's MEMORY_LIMIT setting. Default: `512M`

## Starting from source

Alternative, if you have **PHP 8.1+** and **npm** installed on your local machine, you can boot the application up directly from the source code instead.

First, check out this repo to your desired location. Then, navigate to the `src` directory and run:

```
./startup.sh
```

Alternatively, you can run the commands inside of the `startup.sh` script individually for the same result.

## Deploying

Because this project is contained in a single Dockerfile, it can be deployed immediately to any server provisioned with Docker. Alternatively, the Subvert Docker image can be ran on cloud instances via AWS, Azure, GCP, Fly.io, etc.

> Note: This image currently only exposes the insecure :80 http port.
